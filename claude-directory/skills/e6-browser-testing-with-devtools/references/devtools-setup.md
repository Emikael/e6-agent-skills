# Chrome DevTools Setup and Isolation

Read this only when DevTools setup or profile selection is relevant. Do not install or configure tools just to satisfy a test when an available browser/computer or existing automation can do it. Make setup changes only when the task authorizes setup.

## Setting Up Chrome DevTools MCP

### Installation

Add the following to your project's `.mcp.json` or Claude Code settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chrome-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
    }
  }
}
```

`-y` skips the npx install confirmation. By default the server launches Chrome with its own dedicated profile (under `~/.cache/chrome-devtools-mcp/`), separate from your personal browser; `--isolated` goes one step further and uses a temporary profile that is wiped when the browser closes. This is the right setup for most testing.

There is also `--autoConnect` (Chrome 144+, requires enabling remote debugging via `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging`), which attaches the agent to your **running** Chrome instead. Only use it when the test genuinely needs your logged-in state — read [Profile Isolation](#profile-isolation) below and [SKILL.md › Security boundaries](../SKILL.md#security-boundaries) first.

### Available Tools

Chrome DevTools MCP provides these capabilities:

| Tool | What It Does | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Screenshot** | Captures the current page state | Visual verification, before/after comparisons |
| **DOM Inspection** | Reads the live DOM tree | Verify component rendering, check structure |
| **Console Logs** | Retrieves console output (log, warn, error) | Diagnose errors, verify logging |
| **Network Monitor** | Captures network requests and responses | Verify API calls, check payloads |
| **Performance Trace** | Records performance timing data | Profile load time, identify bottlenecks |
| **Element Styles** | Reads computed styles for elements | Debug CSS issues, verify styling |
| **Accessibility Tree** | Reads the accessibility tree | Verify screen reader experience |
| **JavaScript Execution** | Runs JavaScript in the page context | Read-only state inspection and debugging (see [SKILL.md › Security boundaries](../SKILL.md#security-boundaries)) |

### Profile Isolation

The blast radius of every rule in [SKILL.md › Security boundaries](../SKILL.md#security-boundaries) depends on which browser the agent is attached to. With `--autoConnect`, the agent attaches to your running Chrome's default profile and — per the chrome-devtools-mcp docs — has access to **all open windows** of that profile: logged-in email, banking, GitHub sessions, saved cookies. (`--browser-url` is less exposed by design: Chrome requires a non-default user data directory to enable the remote debugging port — don't defeat that by pointing it at a copy of your real profile.) One page with injected instructions plus an agent holding your authenticated browser is the worst-case combination — the untrusted-data rules in SKILL.md › Security boundaries become the only line of defense instead of one of two.

**Rules:**
- **Default to the dedicated profile** (no connect flags) or `--isolated`. Testing localhost almost never needs your real sessions.
- **If logged-in state is required**, prefer a separate Chrome profile created for testing, signed into only the account under test.
- **If you must attach to your real profile**, close every tab and window unrelated to the test first, and detach when done.
- Treat "the agent can see my open tabs" as a finding to surface to the user, not a convenience to exploit.
