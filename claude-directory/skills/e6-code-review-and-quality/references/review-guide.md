## Structural Remedies

When you flag a structural problem, propose the move — not just the problem. A review that only says "this is complex" leaves the author guessing. Reach for a named restructuring:

- **Replace a chain of conditionals** with a typed model or an explicit dispatcher.
- **Collapse duplicate branches** into a single clearer flow.
- **Separate orchestration from business logic** so each reads on its own.
- **Move feature-specific logic** out of a shared module into the package that owns the concept.
- **Reuse the canonical helper** instead of a bespoke near-duplicate.
- **Make a type boundary explicit** so downstream branching disappears.
- **Delete a pass-through wrapper** that adds indirection without clarifying the API.
- **Extract a helper, or split a large file** into focused modules.

Prefer the remedy that removes moving pieces over one that spreads the same complexity around.

## Change Sizing

Small, focused changes are easier to review and verify. These sizes are inspection heuristics, not merge gates:

```
~100 lines changed   → Good. Reviewable in one sitting.
~300 lines changed   → Acceptable if it's a single logical change.
~1000 lines changed  → Inspect whether independent changes can be split.
```

**Watch file size, not just diff size.** A small diff can still push a file past a healthy boundary — around 1000 *total* lines in a single file (distinct from the ~1000 *changed*-lines threshold above) is a common inspection signal, not a hard cap. When a change materially grows an already-large file, ask whether to extract helpers, subcomponents, or modules *first*, before piling more on. Decompose, then add.

**What counts as "one change":** A single self-contained modification that addresses one thing, includes related tests, and keeps the system functional after submission. One part of a feature — not the whole feature.

**Splitting strategies when a change is too large:**

| Strategy | How | When |
|----------|-----|------|
| **Stack** | Submit a small change, start the next one based on it | Sequential dependencies |
| **By file group** | Separate changes for groups needing different reviewers | Cross-cutting concerns |
| **Horizontal** | Create shared code/stubs first, then consumers | Layered architecture |
| **Vertical** | Break into smaller full-stack slices of the feature | Feature work |

**When large changes are acceptable:** Complete file deletions and automated refactoring where the reviewer only needs to verify intent, not every line.

**Separate refactoring from feature work.** A change that refactors existing code and adds new behavior is two changes — submit them separately. Small in-scope cleanups can stay with implementation when they improve reviewability.

## Change Descriptions

Every change needs a description that stands alone in version control history.

**First line:** Short, imperative, standalone. "Delete the FizzBuzz RPC" not "Deleting the FizzBuzz RPC." Must be informative enough that someone searching history can understand the change without reading the diff.

**Body:** What is changing and why. Include context, decisions, and reasoning not visible in the code itself. Link to bug numbers, benchmark results, or design docs where relevant. Acknowledge approach shortcomings when they exist.

**Anti-patterns:** "Fix bug," "Fix build," "Add patch," "Moving code from A to B," "Phase 1," "Add convenience functions."


## Handling Disagreements

When resolving review disputes, apply this hierarchy:

1. **Technical facts and data** override opinions and preferences
2. **Style guides** are the absolute authority on style matters
3. **Software design** must be evaluated on engineering principles, not personal preference
4. **Codebase consistency** is acceptable if it doesn't degrade overall health

**Don't accept "I'll clean it up later."** Experience shows deferred cleanup rarely happens. Require cleanup before submission unless it's a genuine emergency. If surrounding issues can't be addressed in this change, require filing a bug with self-assignment.

## Honesty in Review

When reviewing code — whether written by you, another agent, or a human:

- **Don't rubber-stamp.** "LGTM" without evidence of review helps no one.
- **Don't soften real issues.** "This might be a minor concern" when it's a bug that will hit production is dishonest.
- **Quantify problems from evidence.** "This loop issues one query per list item (N+1)" is better than "this could be slow." Cite a latency number only when you measured it.
- **Push back on approaches with clear problems.** Sycophancy is a failure mode in reviews. If the implementation has issues, say so directly and propose alternatives.
- **Accept override gracefully.** If the author has full context and disagrees, defer to their judgment. Comment on code, not people — reframe personal critiques to focus on the code itself.

## Dependency Discipline

Part of code review is dependency review:

**Before adding any dependency:**
1. Does the existing stack solve this? (Often it does.)
2. How large is the dependency? (Check bundle impact.)
3. Is it actively maintained? (Check last commit, open issues.)
4. Does it have known vulnerabilities? (the project package manager's native audit)
5. What's the license? (Must be compatible with the project.)

**Rule:** Prefer standard library and existing utilities over new dependencies. Every dependency is a liability.

**Upgrading an existing dependency** is a code change like any other, and the riskiest upgrades are the ones merged in bulk with a message like "bump deps." Review them with the same discipline:

1. **Read the changelog, not just the version number.** Semver is a promise the maintainer may not have kept — a "patch" can carry a behavioral change. For a major bump, read the migration notes and find what breaks.
2. **One dependency per change.** Upgrade and merge them individually (or in small related groups). When a bulk bump breaks the build, you've lost which package did it; a single-package change makes the cause obvious and the revert clean.
3. **Let the tests decide.** The upgrade is verified by a green suite before *and* after, not by "it installed." If coverage around the dependency's behavior is thin, that gap is the real finding — add a test first.
4. **Mind the transitive graph.** Most installed packages are ones nobody chose directly. Review the lockfile diff, not just `package.json`; a single direct bump can pull in dozens of indirect changes.
5. **Keep the lockfile honest.** Commit it, review its diff, and never hand-edit it. The lockfile is the record that pins what ships.

For triaging `npm audit` findings and supply-chain risk (typosquatting, compromised maintainers), follow the `e6-security-and-hardening` skill — this section covers the upgrade *workflow*, that one covers the security verdict.
